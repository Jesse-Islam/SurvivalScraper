"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/simsurv/index.html","simsurv: Simulate Survival Data","Simulate survival times from standard parametric survival distributions (exponential, Weibull, Gompertz), 2-component mixture distributions, or a user-defined hazard, log hazard, cumulative hazard, or log cumulative hazard function. Baseline covariates can be included under a proportional hazards assumption. Time dependent effects (i.e. non-proportional hazards) can be included by interacting covariates with linear time or a user-defined function of time. Clustered event times are also accommodated. The 2-component mixture distributions can allow for a variety of flexible baseline hazard functions reflecting those seen in practice. If the user wishes to provide a user-defined hazard or log hazard function then this is possible, and the resulting cumulative hazard function does not need to have a closed-form solution. Note that this package is modelled on the 'survsim' package available in the 'Stata' software (see Crowther and Lambert (2012) <http://www.stata-journal.com/sjpdf.html?articlenum=st0275> or Crowther and Lambert (2013) <doi:10.1002/sim.5823>)."

with Applications to Survival and Illness-Death Models","Estimation of two-state (survival) models and irreversible illness- death models with possibly interval-censored,left-truncated and right-censored data. Proportional intensities regression models can be specified to allow for covariates effects separately for each transition. We use either a parametric approach with Weibull baseline intensities or a semi-parametric approach with M-splines approximation of baseline intensities in order to obtain smooth estimates of the hazard functions. Parameter estimates are obtained by maximum likelihood in the parametric approach and by penalized maximum likelihood in the semi-parametric approach."

"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spBayesSurv/index.html","spBayesSurv: Bayesian Modeling and Analysis of Spatially Correlated Survival
Data","Provides several Bayesian survival models for spatial/non-spatial survival data: proportional hazards (PH), accelerated failure time (AFT), proportional odds (PO), and accelerated hazards (AH), a super model that includes PH, AFT, PO and AH as special cases, Bayesian nonparametric nonproportional hazards (LDDPM), generalized accelerated failure time (GAFT), and spatially smoothed Polya tree density estimation. The spatial dependence is modeled via frailties under PH, AFT, PO, AH and GAFT, and via copulas under LDDPM and PH. Model choice is carried out via the logarithm of the pseudo marginal likelihood (LPML), the deviance information criterion (DIC), and the Watanabe-Akaike information criterion (WAIC). "

"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/VGAM/index.html","VGAM: Vector Generalized Linear and Additive Models","An implementation of about 6 major classes of statistical regression models. The central algorithm is Fisher scoring and iterative reweighted least squares. At the heart of this package are the vector generalized linear and additive model (VGLM/VGAM) classes. VGLMs can be loosely thought of as multivariate GLMs. VGAMs are data-driven VGLMs that use smoothing. The book ""Vector Generalized Linear and Additive Models: With an Implementation in R"" (Yee, 2015) <doi:10.1007/978-1-4939-2818-7> gives details of the statistical framework and the package. Currently only fixed-effects models are implemented. Many (150+) models and distributions are estimated by maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) or penalized MLE. The other classes are RR-VGLMs (reduced-rank VGLMs), quadratic RR-VGLMs, reduced-rank VGAMs, RCIMs (row-column interaction models)—these classes perform constrained and unconstrained quadratic ordination (CQO/UQO) models in ecology, as well as constrained additive ordination (CAO). Note that these functions are subject to change; see the NEWS and ChangeLog files for latest changes."
"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/YPmodel/index.html","YPmodel: The Short-Term and Long-Term Hazard Ratio Model for Survival
Data","Inference procedures accommodate a flexible range of hazard ratio patterns with a two-sample semi-parametric model. This model contains the proportional hazards model and the proportional odds model as sub-models, and accommodates non-proportional hazards situations to the extreme of having crossing hazards and crossing survivor functions. Overall, this package has four major functions: 1) the parameter estimation, namely short-term and long-term hazard ratio parameters; 2) 95 percent and 90 percent point-wise confidence intervals and simultaneous confidence bands for the hazard ratio function; 3) p-value of the adaptive weighted log-rank test; 4) p-values of two lack-of-fit tests for the model. See the included ""read_me_first.pdf"" for brief instructions. In this version (1.1), there is no need to sort the data before applying this package."
